### `useState(..)` Hook

The TNG `useState(..)` hook, like [React's `useState(..)` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), allows an Articulated Function to persist a unit of state across multiple invocations, without relying on global variables or having to manually create a closure to store that state.

For example:

<NewEditor id="useState-1" 

codeString={`function hit() {
    var [count, updateCount] = useState(0);

    count++;
    updateCount(count);
}

hit = TNG(hit);

hit();       // Hit count: 1
hit();       // Hit count: 2
hit();       // Hit count: 3`}
client:only="react"
/>

The `useState(..)` hook function takes either a direct value, or a function which returns that value. Whichever way it's provided, this value is used only the first time as the initial value for that unit of state.

The return value of `useState(..)` is a tuple (2-element array) containing the current value of that unit of state, as well as a function to use to set/update that unit of state. You can name this unit of state whatever is appropriate, and also name the set/update function whatever is appropriate.

In the above snippet, we used array destructuring to set `count` and `updateCount` from the tuple returned from `useState(..)`.

The setter/updater (`updateCount(..)` in the above snippet) normally receives a single value. Alternatively, you can pass a function, which will receive the current value of that state unit as its only argument, and which should return the new value for that state unit.

For example:

<NewEditor id="useState-2" 
codeString={`function hit() {
    var [count, updateCount] = useState(0);

    updateCount(onUpdateCount);
}

function onUpdateCount(oldCount) {
    return oldCount + 1;
}

hit = TNG(hit);

hit();       // Hit count: 1
hit();       // Hit count: 2
hit();       // Hit count: 3`}
client:only="react"
/>

This approach is helpful for determining the new state unit value based on its current value, especially if, as shown above, the setter/updater function is not inside the closure and cannot access the current state unit value directly.

In this particular example, the line `updateCount(onUpdateCount)` could also have been written with the same outcome as:

<NewEditor id="useState-3" 
codeString={`updateCount(onUpdateCount(count));`}
client:only="react"
/>

The `onUpdateCount(count)` is passed the current `count` value manually, which returns an updated value; that updated value is passed directly to `updateCount(..)` to be set.
