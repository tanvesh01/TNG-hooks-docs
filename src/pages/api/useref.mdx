### `useRef(..)` Hook

Similar to [React's `useRef(..)` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref), the TNG `useRef(..)` hook creates an object stored persistently in a state slot (via the [`useState(..)` hook](#usestate-hook)), and creates a property on it called `current` which holds a specified initial value, if any.

For example:

<NewEditor id="useRef-1" 

codeString={`function hit() {
    var counter = useRef(0);

    counter.current++;

    console.log(\`${templatingString}\`);
}

hit = TNG(hit);

hit();       // Hit count: 1
hit();       // Hit count: 2
hit();       // Hit count: 3`}
client:only="react"

/>

It may be more convenient to pass around the reference to this persistent object, and make any updates to its `current` property (or add/remove other properties), than to have to pass around both a state value and its updater function.
