### `useReducer(..)` Hook

Like [React's `useReducer(..)` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer), the TNG `useReducer(..)` hook is like a special case of [TNG's `useState(..)` hook](#usestate-hook) in that it also provides for persistent state storage across invocations; but it's especially helpful for certain cases when the state updates are more involved.

`useReducer(..)` expects a reducer function and an initial value for its state unit.

For example:
<NewEditor id="useReducer-1"
codeString={`function hit( amount = 1 ) {
    var [count, incCounter] = useReducer(updateCounter, 0);
    incCounter(amount);

    console.log(\`Hit count: ${countString}\`);
}

function updateCounter(prevCount, val) {
    return prevCount + val;
}

hit = TNG(hit);

hit();       // Hit count: 1
hit();       // Hit count: 2
hit(8);      // Hit count: 10`}
client:only="react"
/>

Optionally, you can pass a third argument to `useReducer(..)` (value `5` in the following snippet), which specifies a value to be used in invoking the reducer immediately on this initial pass:

<NewEditor id="useReducer-2" 
codeString={`function hit( amount = 1 ) {
    var [count, incCounter] = useReducer(updateCounter, 0, 5);
    incCounter(amount);

    console.log(\`Hit count: ${countString}\`);
}

function updateCounter(prevCount,val) {
    return prevCount + val;
}

hit = TNG(hit);

hit();       // Hit count: 6
hit();       // Hit count: 7
hit(3);      // Hit count: 10`}
client:only="react"

/>

The line `useReducer(updateCounter, 0, 5)` immediately invokes `updateCounter(0,5)`, which returns `5`, and the state unit (named `count` here) is then initially set to *that* `5` value.
