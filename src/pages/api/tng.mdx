### `TNG(..)`

TNG provides hooks which deliberately resemble React's hooks. However, as TNG is a separate project, there are some important nuances and differences to pay close attention to.

`TNG(..)` is a utility to produce [Articulated Functions](#articulated-functions) from normal, stanadlone functions. Articulated Functions adopt an active hooks-context to enable hooks capabilities.

For example:

<NewEditor id="TNG-1" 

codeString={`// wrap one function at a time
foo = TNG(foo);

// or, wrap multiple functions at once
[bar, baz] = TNG(bar, baz);

function foo() {  }
function bar() {  }
function baz() {  }`}
client:only="react"
/>
The same function can actually be Articulated multiple times, with each one getting its own separate TNG hooks-context:

<NewEditor id="TNG-2"  codeString={`function foo() {  }

var [A, B] = TNG(foo, foo);
var C = TNG(foo);

// later:
A();        // own separate TNG hooks-context
B();        // ditto
C();        // ditto
`}

client:only="react"
/>

Articulated Functions have the same signature as the functions they wrap, including any arguments, return value, and the ability to be invoked with a `this` context if desired.

#### Resetting Hooks-Context

Articulated Functions also have a method defined on them called `reset()`. The `reset()` method resets the internal TNG hooks-context of an Articulated Function, including any state slots, effects, etc.

For example:


<NewEditor id="TNG-3"
codeString={`function hit() {
    var [count,updateCount] = useState(0);

    count++;
    updateCount(count);
}

hit = TNG(hit);

hit();       // Hit count: 1
hit();       // Hit count: 2
hit();       // Hit count: 3

hit.reset();

hit();       // Hit count: 1`}

 client:only="react"
/>

Also, if an Articulated Function has any [pending effect cleanup functions](#effect-cleanups), `reset()` will trigger them. See [`useEffect(..)`](#useeffect-hook) for more information on effects and cleanups.
