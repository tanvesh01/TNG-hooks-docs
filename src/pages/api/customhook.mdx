### Custom Hooks

If any TNG hooks are used in a non-Articulated Function, it behaves essentially like a [React "Custom Hook"](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html). A TNG Custom Hook ***must be called***, directly or indirectly, from an Articulated Function, so that it has an active TNG hooks-context available to use.

For example:

<NewEditor id="useCustomHook-1" 

codeString={`// a Custom Hook, ***not*** an Articulated Function
function useHitCounter() {
    // inherited TNG hooks-context
    var [count, updateCount] = useState(0);

    count++;
    updateCount(count);

    return count;
}

// will be TNG(..) Articulated twice, once as
// each button's click handler
function onClick(evt) {
    // using a Custom Hook
    var hitCount = useHitCounter();

    console.log(\`${templatingString}\`);
}

var fooBtn = document.getElementById("foo-btn");
var barBtn = document.getElementById("bar-btn");

// each click handler is an Articulated onClick()
fooBtn.addEventListener("click", TNG(onClick), false);
barBtn.addEventListener("click", TNG(onClick), false);`}
client:only="react"

/>

**Note:** Unlike React, TNG does not ***require*** naming Custom Hooks in the format `useWHATEVER(..)` with a `use` prefix. You *can do so* if you prefer, as we did in the above snippet. See the [rules of TNG hooks](#hook-call-rules) below.

The `useHitCounter(..)` Custom Hook -- again, just a normal non-Articulated Function that uses a TNG hook like `useState(..)`! -- inherits the TNG hooks-context of the Articulated Function that invoked it. In this example, the invoking Articulated Function is either one of the two click handlers (produced via the two `TNG(..)` calls) that were bound, respectively, as each button's click handler.

In other words, the line `var [count,updateCount] = useState(0);` acts as if it had actually been called inside of one of the click handlers, even though it's in the separate `useHitCounter(..)` function; that's what makes `useHitCounter(..)` a Custom Hook, meaning it can be called from any Articulated Function.
